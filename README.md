# Restoration-of-Damaged-Murals
modifiedmeanmethod.m contains our algorithms used for crack detection crack classification and crack filling using modified mean filter
modifiedmeadianmethod.m contains our algorithms used for crack detection crack classification and crack filling using modified median filter

The output of the process is A - an image
The cracks are stored in the variable cracks - a binary image
The original image is stored in an variable called original

We have also tried implementing an high boost filter to sharpen the image.
All codes were tested and implemented on MATLAB 2010!

All the codes are commented for better read!
